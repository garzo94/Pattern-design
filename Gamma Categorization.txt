    - Deal with the creation of objects
    - Explicit vs implicit
    - Wholesale vs pircewise (step by step)
Structural patterns
    - Concerned with the structure
    - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
    - Sress the importance of good API design
Behavior patterns
    - They are all different; no central theme
